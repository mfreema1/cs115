    "A class is a blueprint for an object.  Classes contain properties (often called attributes or fields) and methods (functions) that change the state of the object.  We'll start with a special method called the constructor, whose purpose is to initialize the fields of the object.  When you invoke the constructor and create an object value, you have performed instantiation."
